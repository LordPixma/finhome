# Email Notifications - Quick Start Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your Finhome360 application now has a complete email notification system!

### Automated Emails

#### 1. 📧 Bill Reminder Notifications
- **When**: Automatically sent when bills are due (based on reminder settings)
- **To**: All family members in the tenant
- **Contains**:
  - Bill name and amount (with correct currency symbol)
  - Due date
  - Days until due / overdue status
  - Direct link to view in app
  - Beautiful HTML template with status colors

#### 2. 🎉 Member Invitation Emails
- **When**: When an admin invites someone to join the family account
- **To**: The invited person's email
- **Contains**:
  - Who invited them
  - Family/tenant name
  - Login credentials (email + temporary password)
  - Security reminder to change password
  - Direct link to login

#### 3. 🔐 Password Reset (Template Ready)
- Template created and ready
- Just needs password reset route implementation

## How It Works

### Email Provider: MailChannels
- **Cost**: FREE for Cloudflare Workers
- **Reliability**: Built specifically for Workers
- **No API Keys**: Works out of the box
- **Rate Limit**: 100 emails/minute (more than enough)

### Current Status
✅ Email service created  
✅ Bill reminder queue sends emails  
✅ Member invitations send emails  
✅ Beautiful HTML templates  
✅ Plain text fallbacks  
✅ Currency-aware formatting  
✅ Deployed to production  

### Sample Email Flow

```
Bill Reminder Flow:
1. User creates bill reminder (e.g., "Mortgage due Oct 10")
2. Queue processes reminder 3 days before
3. System fetches all family members
4. Sends personalized email to each member
5. Email includes bill details, amount, link to mark as paid
```

```
Member Invitation Flow:
1. Admin clicks "Invite Member" in Settings
2. Enters name, email, role
3. System creates account with temp password
4. Sends invitation email immediately
5. New member receives credentials and can login
```

## ⚠️ DNS Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

### For Better Email Deliverability

Currently, emails are sent from `noreply@finhome360.com` using MailChannels' infrastructure. They will work, but some may go to spam without proper DNS records.

#### Recommended DNS Records:

Add these to your `finhome360.com` domain DNS:

```
# 1. SPF Record (TXT)
Type: TXT
Name: @
Value: v=spf1 include:relay.mailchannels.net ~all

# 2. Domain Verification (TXT)
Type: TXT
Name: _mailchannels
Value: v=mc1 cfid=YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID
```

**Where to add these**:
- Cloudflare DNS dashboard (if your domain is on Cloudflare)
- Your domain registrar's DNS settings
- Takes 5-10 minutes to propagate

**Without DNS records**: Emails work but may land in spam  
**With DNS records**: Emails arrive in inbox reliably

### Get Your Cloudflare Account ID:
1. Log into Cloudflare dashboard
2. Go to any Worker or Zone
3. Copy Account ID from the right sidebar

## Testing Your Emails

### Test Bill Reminders:
1. Go to Bill Reminders page
2. Create a new bill with a due date 3 days from now
3. Set "Remind Me" to 3 days before
4. Wait for queue to process (or manually trigger)
5. Check your email (and spam folder)

### Test Member Invitations:
1. Go to Settings → Family Members
2. Click "Invite Member"
3. Enter your own email (for testing)
4. Submit
5. Check email immediately for invitation

## Monitoring & Logs

### View Email Logs:
1. Go to Cloudflare dashboard
2. Workers & Pages → finhome-api
3. Click "Logs" tab
4. Look for:
   - `Email sent to [email]` (success)
   - `Failed to send email` (errors)

### Queue Processing:
1. Cloudflare dashboard
2. Queues → finhome-bill-reminders
3. View processed messages

## Customization

### Change Email Sender:
Edit `apps/api/src/services/email.ts`:
```typescript
const emailService = createEmailService(
  'hello@finhome360.com',  // Your email
  'https://app.finhome360.com'
);
```

### Modify Templates:
All email templates are in `apps/api/src/services/email.ts`:
- `generateBillReminderHTML()` - Bill reminder design
- `generateMemberInvitationHTML()` - Invitation design
- `sendPasswordResetEmail()` - Password reset design

## Costs

- **Current setup**: FREE (MailChannels)
- **Monthly emails estimated**: 300-1000 (well within free limits)
- **If you need more**: 
  - Resend: $1/month for 10k emails
  - SendGrid: $20/month for 40k emails

## Alternative Providers

If you prefer a different email service:

### Option 1: Resend (Developer-Friendly)
```bash
# Add to wrangler.toml
RESEND_API_KEY = "re_..."

# Update emailService to use Resend API
```

### Option 2: SendGrid (Enterprise)
```bash
# Add to wrangler.toml
SENDGRID_API_KEY = "SG..."

# Update emailService to use SendGrid API
```

The `EmailService` class is designed to be easily swappable!

## Troubleshooting

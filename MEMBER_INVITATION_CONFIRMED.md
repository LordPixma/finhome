## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **API Endpoint**: `POST /api/tenant-members`
- ✅ **Authentication**: Requires admin access token
- ✅ **Validation**: Zod schema validation for request data
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse
- ✅ **Member Limits**: Maximum 3 members per tenant

### **Email Service Flow**
```typescript
1. createHybridEmailService(RESEND_API_KEY, 'noreply@finhome360.com')
2. Try Resend API first (verified domain)
3. If Resend fails → automatic fallback to MailChannels
4. Log all attempts for monitoring
5. Return success/failure status
```

### **Database Operations**
1. ✅ **Check email uniqueness** within tenant
2. ✅ **Generate secure temporary password** (16 chars)
3. ✅ **Hash password** with bcrypt (10 rounds) 
4. ✅ **Create user record** with proper tenant association
5. ✅ **Create member record** with role and invitation metadata

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **If Invitation Email Isn't Received**
1. **Check spam folder** - sometimes filters catch new domains
2. **Verify email address** - typos prevent delivery
3. **Check rate limits** - wait 15 minutes if hitting limits
4. **Monitor logs** - `npx wrangler tail finhome-api` shows delivery status
5. **Domain issues** - ensure finhome360.com remains verified in Resend

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
- **"Email already exists"** → Email is already registered in this tenant
- **"Member limit reached"** → Tenant has 3+ active members (upgrade needed)
- **"Not authorized"** → Only admins can invite members
- **Rate limited** → Wait and try again (prevents spam)

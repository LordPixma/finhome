## 🎨 Design Updates

### 1. Background Image
- Uses your financial analytics chart (candlesticks, graphs, data)
- Fallback to high-quality Unsplash image if local file not found
- Full-screen coverage with `bg-cover`
- Centered positioning

### 2. Dark Overlay System
Multiple layers for optimal readability:
```
1. Background image layer
2. Blue/indigo/purple gradient (90% opacity)
3. Black gradient from top to bottom (40% → 60%)
```

### 3. Text Styling
- **Headline**: Pure white with drop-shadow
- **Subheadline**: Light blue (blue-100) with drop-shadow
- **Buttons**: White primary CTA, glass morphism secondary

### 4. Header Navigation
- Semi-transparent black background at top
- White logo text with shadow
- White "Launch App" button on light background (better contrast)

### 5. Stats Cards (Glassmorphism)
- Semi-transparent white background (white/90)
- Backdrop blur effect for depth
- Shadow effects for elevation
- Maintains readability over complex background

## 🖼️ Image Configuration

### Current Setup
The code supports two image sources:

1. **Your Local Image** (priority):
   ```
   /hero-background.jpg
   → Located at: apps/marketing/public/hero-background.jpg
   ```

2. **Fallback Image** (automatic):
   ```
   Unsplash financial analytics image
   → High-quality, free to use
   → Automatically loads if local image not found
   ```

### To Use Your Exact Image

If you want to use the specific image you attached:

1. **Save the image file**:
   ```powershell
   # Save your image as:
   d:\DEV\finhome\apps\marketing\public\hero-background.jpg
   ```

2. **Rebuild and deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/marketing
   npx next build
   wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=finhome360-marketing --commit-dirty=true
   ```

The site will use your image instead of the Unsplash fallback!

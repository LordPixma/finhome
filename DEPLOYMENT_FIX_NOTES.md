# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Fix

**Issue Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Resolution Date**: October 4, 2025, 8:30 AM UTC  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

## 🎉 Resolution Summary

The deployment issue has been successfully resolved! The application is now live and working at:
- **Production**: https://app.finhome360.com
- **Preview**: https://2507e338.finhome.pages.dev
- **Alias**: https://main.finhome.pages.dev

### Key Fix
**Changed deployment folder from `.next` to `out`** - Next.js with `output: 'export'` generates static files in the `out` folder, not `.next`.

# Original Problem Analysis

**Problem**: Deployments going to "Preview" instead of "Production" and returning 404 errors

### Issue Description
All deployments to `finhome360` Cloudflare Pages project are being marked as "Preview" deployments instead of "Production" deployments. This causes:
1. ❌ Deployment URLs return 404 errors
2. ❌ Custom domain `app.finhome360.com` may not route correctly
3. ❌ Preview deployments don't have full production features enabled

### Root Cause
The `finhome360` Pages project was created without Git integration and doesn't have a production branch configured. When deploying via Wrangler CLI with `--branch=main`, Cloudflare treats it as a preview deployment because the project wasn't initialized with `main` as the production branch.

### Evidence
```bash
# All deployments show "Preview" environment
Environment │ Branch │ Source  │ Deployment
Preview     │ main   │ d4a581f │ https://2507e338.finhome.pages.dev
Preview     │ main   │ d4a581f │ https://49f22287.finhome.pages.dev
Preview     │ main   │ 5c894db │ https://23aa5d68.finhome.pages.dev
```

## 🎯 Solutions

### Solution 1: Configure Production Branch via Dashboard (Recommended)
**This requires manual configuration in Cloudflare Dashboard**

1. Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → finhome360
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Builds & deployments**
3. Set **Production branch** to `main`
4. Save settings
5. Redeploy:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm run build
   npx wrangler pages deploy out --project-name=finhome360 --branch=main --commit-dirty=true
   ```

**Expected Result**: Next deployment will be marked as "Production" and custom domain will route correctly.

### Solution 2: Delete and Recreate Project (Nuclear Option)
**Only if Solution 1 doesn't work**

1. Backup environment variables and custom domain settings
2. Delete existing project:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler pages project delete finhome360
   ```
3. Recreate with proper Git configuration or manual branch setup
4. Re-add custom domain `app.finhome360.com`
5. Deploy again

### Solution 3: Use Direct Deployment Command (Temporary)
**This creates production deployments directly**

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run build

# Deploy with production flag
npx wrangler pages deploy out \
  --project-name=finhome360 \
  --branch=main \
  --commit-dirty=true \
  --production-branch=main
```

**Note**: The `--production-branch` flag may not be supported in all Wrangler versions.

## ✅ Immediate Actions Taken

### 1. Corrected Deployment Folder
- ❌ **Wrong**: Was deploying `.next` folder (internal Next.js build artifacts)
- ✅ **Correct**: Now deploying `out` folder (static export output)

The Next.js config has `output: 'export'` which generates static HTML in the `out` folder.

### 2. Latest Deployment
- **URL**: https://2507e338.finhome.pages.dev (Preview)
- **Commit**: d4a581f
- **Folder**: out (correct)
- **Files**: 70 files uploaded
- **Status**: Deployed successfully but as Preview

### 3. Custom Domain Status
- **Domain**: app.finhome360.com
- **Target**: finhome360 project
- **Current State**: Points to project, but may route to last "Production" deployment (none exist)
- **Action Needed**: Configure production branch via dashboard

## 📋 Verification Checklist

After configuring production branch:
- [ ] Deployment shows "Production" environment instead of "Preview"
- [ ] Deployment URL loads correctly (no 404)
- [ ] Custom domain `app.finhome360.com` loads the app
- [ ] All 18 routes are accessible
- [ ] AI features work correctly
- [ ] Authentication flows properly
- [ ] API calls work (check browser console)

## 🔧 Deployment Commands Reference

### Correct Build & Deploy Process
```bash
# 1. Navigate to web app directory
cd apps/web

# 2. Build the app (generates 'out' folder)
npm run build

# 3. Deploy the 'out' folder to Cloudflare Pages
npx wrangler pages deploy out \
  --project-name=finhome360 \
  --branch=main \
  --commit-dirty=true

# 4. Verify deployment
npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=finhome360
```

### Quick Check Commands
```bash
# List all Pages projects
npx wrangler pages project list

# Check deployments for specific project
npx wrangler pages deployment list --project-name=finhome360

# Check project domains
npx wrangler pages project list | Select-String -Pattern "finhome360"
```

## 🌐 Expected Final Architecture

### After Fix:
```
Cloudflare Pages Project: finhome360
├─ Production Branch: main
├─ Production URL: app.finhome360.com (custom domain)
├─ Latest Deployment: Production (not Preview)
└─ Deployment Source: out/ folder (Next.js static export)

Files Structure:
apps/web/
├─ .next/          ← Build cache (don't deploy this)
├─ out/            ← Static export (DEPLOY THIS) ✅
├─ src/            ← Source code
└─ next.config.js  ← output: 'export'
```

## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start the Backend API
```powershell
cd D:\DEV\finhome\apps\api
npm run dev
```

The API will start at `http://localhost:8787`

### 2. Start the Frontend
```powershell
cd D:\DEV\finhome\apps\web
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Login with Demo Credentials

**Admin User:**
- Email: `admin@demofamily.com`
- Password: `password123`

**Member User:**

## 📋 What's Next

The following pages still need to be built:

1. **Accounts Page** - Manage financial accounts
2. **Transactions Page** - View and add transactions with filtering
3. **Budgets Page** - Set and track budgets
4. **Categories Page** - Manage transaction categories
5. **Bill Reminders Page** - Track recurring bills
6. **Analytics Page** - Charts and spending insights
7. **Import Page** - Upload CSV/OFX files

I can continue building these pages if you'd like! Each page will follow the same beautiful design system.

## 🎨 Design System

- **Colors**: Blue (primary), Green (income), Red (expenses), Purple/Pink (accents)
- **Typography**: Inter font (Google Fonts)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- TypeScript errors for Next.js imports will resolve when dev server runs
- Need to add error boundaries for production
- Should add loading skeletons instead of spinners
- Need to add toast notifications for user feedback

## 🎯 Current Progress

**Completed:** 4/12 tasks (33%)
- ✅ API Client & Auth
